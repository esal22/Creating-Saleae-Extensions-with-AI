# HLA Generation using AI
This is an experimental project using Anthropic's claude.ai engine (Claude 3 Opus) go generate a python based HLA (High Level Analyzer) for Saleae's Logic2 software. Logic2 is the software user interface for Saleae's Logic 8, Logic Pro 8, and Logic Pro 16 series of Logic Analyzer hardware.  In this example the digital I2C signals are capture between an Adafruit Featherwing M0 and SH1107 based monochrome OLED display driver. The HLA adds human readable annotations above each frame in the I2C communication capture in the Logic2 software.


The following items are included in each experiment repository:
- Claude Chat Transcript
- HLA Reference Design (Before Code Gen)
- HLA - Generated Result (After Code Gen)
- Raw Data Capture from Logic2
- Saleae Extension Documentation
